# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course - Project 1
---

### Project 1 Task
------
For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users. 

### Project Features
------
* Responsive Design built using CSS Flexbox.
* The ability to filter restaurants by neighborhood and cuisine type.
* A Google Map with animated Google Map Markers retrieved asynchronously from the **Google Maps API**.
* Accessibility features.
* A simple offline-first caching strategy using a service worker.

### Getting started
------

First go to the master branch of the project and get a copy of the repository by either downloading the zipped project files to your computer or via the command line.

```sh
https://github.com/LeaSak/mws-restaurant-stage-1
```

To view the app, navigate to the project, go to the project's **dist** directory. n this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. For example, with Python: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

So far it's only been tested in Google Chrome.

All development files are located in the **src** directory. This project was built using Gulp. For more information, please inspect **gulpfile.js**
